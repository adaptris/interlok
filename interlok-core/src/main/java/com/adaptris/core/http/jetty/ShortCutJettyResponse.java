/**
* Allows you to short cut {@link JettyPoolingWorkflowInterceptor} behaviour in a {@link PoolingWorkflow}.
* <p>
* Normally, the response is not committed until the workflow is complete. If you have a workflow bound to HTTP that takes a
* significant amount of time then this can cause arbitrary timeouts within firewalls and proxies. If the client sends a
* {@code Expect: 102-Processing} header, then the adapter will automatically send a 102 response every 20 seconds or so until the
* workflow has finished. This service allows you to shortcut that behaviour and commit a response before the underlying workflow is
* complete. You will still need to use {@link StandardResponseProducer} prior to using this service.
* </p>
* <p>
* While not strictly enforced, you should consider returning a {@code 202 ACCEPTED} rather than a {@code 200 OK} if you are going
* to send the response before the end of the workflow. This would be the more "correct" behaviour as per the HTTP specifications.
* </p>
