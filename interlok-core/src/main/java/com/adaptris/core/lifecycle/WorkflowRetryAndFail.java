 * Strategy for starting workflows that retries a workflow init or start a number of times.

 * This implementation allows you to retry the init and start for a given workflow a configurable number of times. Each workflow is
 * attempted in sequence, and the failing workflow is retried until either it is successful or the max number of retry attempts has
 * been reached. If the workflow has still failed at this point, an exception is thrown back to the parent channel.
