/**
*
* Ignore all exceptions coming nested services, including Timeouts
*
* <p>
* This is included for completeness, since there are some obvious gotchas this class as part of a
* {@link PooledSplitJoinService}
* <ul>
* <li>If your aggregator is sensitive to payload structure (e.g you're aggregating as a JSON ARRAY,
* but because of failures, the message to be aggregated is in fact XML) then you have to use a
* {@link Condition} to filter the message somehow</li>
* <li>If your aggregator isn't sensitive to payloads (e.g. an {@link AppendingMessageAggregator}
* then you may still end up with a mix of JSON/XML</li>
* <li>Exceptions may still be thrown by the aggregator, and they will be propagated to the service;
* this only ignores exceptions that come from the service-list executed as part of the
* {@code splitter}.</li>
* </ul>
