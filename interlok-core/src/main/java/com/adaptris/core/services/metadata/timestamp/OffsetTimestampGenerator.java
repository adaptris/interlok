   * Set the offset for the timestamp.
   * <p>
   * The offset follows the ISO8601 convention for durations. The format is
   * <strong>[+-]P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S</strong>. In these representations,
   * the [n] is replaced by the value for each of the date and time elements
   * that follow the [n]. Leading zeros are not required. The capital letters
   * 'P', 'Y', 'M', 'W', 'D', 'T', 'H', 'M', and 'S' are designators for each of
   * the date and time elements and are not replaced.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * <ul>
   * <li>P is the duration designator (historically called "period") placed at
   * the start of the duration representation.</li>
   * <li>Y is the year designator that follows the value for the number of
   * years.</li>
   * <li>M is the month designator that follows the value for the number of
   * months.</li>
   * <li>W is the week designator that follows the value for the number of
   * weeks.</li>
   * <li>D is the day designator that follows the value for the number of days.</li>
   * <li>T is the time designator that precedes the time components of the
   * representation.</li>
   * <li>H is the hour designator that follows the value for the number of
   * hours.</li>
   * <li>M is the minute designator that follows the value for the number of
   * minutes.</li>
   * <li>S is the second designator that follows the value for the number of
   * seconds.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * For example, <code>P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S</code> represents a duration of three
   * years, six months, four days, twelve hours, thirty minutes, and five
   * seconds . Date and time elements including their designator may be omitted
   * if their value is zero, and lower order elements may also be omitted for
   * reduced precision. For example, "P23DT23H" and "P4Y" are both acceptable
   * duration representations.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * To resolve ambiguity, "P1M" is a one-month duration and "PT1M" is a
   * one-minute duration (note the time designator, T, that precedes the time
   * value). The seconds value used may also have a decimal fraction, as in
   * "PT0.5S" to indicate half a second."PT36H" could be used as well as
   * "P1DT12H" for representing the same duration.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * A negative period will become some date in the past; a positive or
   * unspecified period will resolve to some time in the future. For example
   * <code>-P30D</code> will resolve to 30 days ago, whereas <code>P30D</code>
   * will resolve to 30 days in the future.
   * </p>
   *
   * @param offset the offset.
